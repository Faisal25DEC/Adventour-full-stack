Once a hill range extending from Myanmar to Indonesia, these picturesque undulating islands, islets numbering around 572, are covered with dense rain-fed, damp and evergreen forests and endless varieties of exotic flora and fauna. Most of these islands (about 550) are in the Andaman Group, 28 of which are inhabited. The smaller Nicobars, comprise some 22 main islands (10 inhabited). The Andaman and Nicobars are separated by the Ten Degree Channel which is 150 Kms. wide.",
      "climate": "The islands have a tropical climate. The South-west Monsoon sets in Andaman Nicobar islands towards the end of May and the North-east Monsoon in November. There is no fury of hot summer, no chilling winter, no water clogging or traffic jams. For those who want to enjoy boating, swimming, snorkeling, sightseeing all 12 months is season. North Indians find relief from burning heat and chilling winter if they visit the island from May/June/July and in December/January. Season for nature lovers is May to December when forest is lush green and waterfalls are at their prime. Divers can enjoy the best during December to April and bird watchers during winter times.",
      "history": "The Andaman & Nicobar Islands have been inhabited for several thousand years, at the very least. The earlier archaeological evidence yet documented goes back some 2,200 years; however, the indications from genetic, cultural and linguistic isolation studies point to habitation going back 30,000 – 60,000 years, well into the Middle Palaeolithic. In the Andaman Islands, the various Andamanese people maintained their separated existence through the vast majority of this time, diversifying into distinct linguistic, cultural and territorial groups.",

There are no severe climate conditions except for tropical storms and rains in late summers and monsoons.Summers (March to May) are warm but pleasant with sea breeze and have humidity level about 80%. It is suitable for all kinds of tourist activities.",
      "food": "The cuisine Of Andaman is like the island itself-tropical, exotic and refreshing. The sea that is all around has a defining effect on the island's culture, livelihood and cuisine. There is little here, in which you will not find traces of the sea. The food here, hence, is dominated by seafood preparations and you don't want to miss the fish delicacies here. Other than seafood too, the staple diet is essentially non-vegetarian.However, as the island is becoming an increasingly popular tourist spot, the resorts and other eating places will give you options of Indian, Chinese and a few more cuisines.Also, the fruits here are popular and refreshing. You can find Mangoes, Bananas, Pineapples, Guava and more. One can also sip in the truly refreshing and tropical coconut water here.",

Located on the north-western edge of India, it is one of the smaller albeit prosperous states of the nation, and home to a lively, hospitable and dynamic people. Widely acknowledged as the cradle of civilization, it is a land of ethnic and religious diversity, having borne and shaped a number of religious movements that include Sikhism, Buddhism and Sufism. The Punjabi language, too, finds its origin in the Indo-European linguistic family that includes Persian and Latin.",
      "climate": "The Summer in Punjab actually commences from mid April but the temperature starts rising from February onwards. Rainfall ranges from 250mm to 1000mm. Agriculture in the state highly depends on the rains. The winter season in Punjab is mostly experienced in the month of January, when the temperature falls to 5°C in the night and hovers around 12°C in the day. In the post winter transitional season, hail-storms and brief showers occur which cause damage to the crops. The wind becomes dry by the end of March. The Punjab climate has been a significant factor in shaping the economy of the state.",
      "history": "The history of Punjab goes back thousands of years. Undivided Punjab has been the cradle of the Indus Valley Civilization, the remains of which can be seen at the Ropar archaeological site and its dedicated museum. This fertile ancient land finds mention even in Mahabharata and Ramayana. Infact it is believed that the Ramayana was written here by Valmiki ji. Places like Rupnagar, Kiratpur, Dholbaha, Rohira and Ghuram...all in Punjab; have unearthed artifacts that date back centuries. In Sanghol are 107 statues of the Kushan period evoking memories of a flourishing Buddhist monastery. This monastery was visited by Hiuen Tsang in the 7th century.",
      "time": "The best time to visit Punjab is in the spring, from February to April, and in the autumn, from September to November.",
      "food": "Punjab is synonymous to food and incomplete without its mouthwatering delicacies. Rich in colour, ingredients, spices and the most elaborate and grand cooking styles, Punjabi food derives several elements of its cuisine from Pakistan, the then undivided Punjab.The national cuisine borrows some of its most popular and lip-smacking items from Punjab's menu from Paratha, Tandoori Chicken, Naan, Pakodas to delicacies of Paneer. The food here represents a particular festivity, vibrancy and cultural richness in every day, a big part of which revolves around having good and rich food. There is also an almost perfect balance between the vegetarian and non-vegetarian choices, the options being equally irresistible for both. Punjabi cuisine is nearly identified with generous use of 'Ghee' or butter to give the food a rich flavour. Also onion, ginger, garlic and strong spice leave strong and distinct flavours in the menu here. Butter Chicken, Tandoori Chicken, Shahi Paneer, Chole Bhature, Makki di roti, Sarson da Saag, Dal fry, Amritsari fish, Aloo gobhi, Rajma Chawal, Punjabi Kadhi, Lassi are the dishes that define the food here, and the list is almost infinite. Gajar ka Halwa, Jalebi, Kulfi, Rabri, Gulab Jamun, Barfi, Motichoor Laddo are also equally tempting traditional sweets in the area.",

Also, the crafts and folk arts originated here are world famous.With the legendary cities of Jaipur, Udaipur, Jaisalmer, and Jodhpur, built by the Rajput warriors, and the artisan communities and indigenous tribal, Rajasthan is a unique combination of royal and tribal India. Rajputs ruled the Land of Royalty for a long time and till today they are regarded in very high esteem.",
      "climate": "Summers in Rajasthan last from April to June and are particularly harsh with temperatures rising up to 48°C during the day. That being said, if you do plan to visit Rajasthan in the summer, head to places like Mount Abu, Kumbhalgarh or Ranakpur. The weather here is pleasant and the views offered are breath-taking. For other cities, the weather is optimal in the early evenings for roaming around outside in the early mornings and late evenings, and it is advisable to stay indoors otherwise.Monsoon is a far more pleasant experience, the temperatures tend to drop across the state and the rain showers transform the arid landscape of Rajasthan. July to September is a particularly good time to visit if you wish to avoid the crowds you'd usually find during peak tourist season. Bundi, the lake city of Udaipur and the Keoladeo National Park are picturesque and are a must visit if you plan to travel to Rajasthan during the Monsoon.",
      "history": "The state of Rajasthan in India has a history dating back thousands of years. It was the site of the Indus Valley Civilization. The early medieval period saw the rise of the Mughal Empire. The Mughals granted high positions to Rajput rulers who allied with them. However, some Rajput kingdoms did not accept Mughal suzerainty and were constantly at war with them. The Mughal rule effectively ended in the 18th century, when the Maratha Empire conquered much of the subcontinent.\n\nMaratha rule was soon replaced by British rule in India. The British also made allies out of local rulers, who were allowed to rule their princely states. This period was marked by famines and economic exploitation. However, the British period also saw the growth of railways, telegraph and modern industry in the region. After Indian Independence in 1947, the various princely states of Rajasthan were integrated into India.",
      "time": "The temperatures continue to drop once the monsoon has passed, and come October winter sets in that lasts till March. During December and January, there can be a severe variation in temperatures during the day and the night. In fact, temperatures are known to drop as low as 0°C and below. This is the best time to visit Rajasthan as the desert sun is not as intense and the days are pleasant. Most of the festivals held in winter are planned as tourist attractions, with visitors coming in from different parts of the world.",
      "food": "Rajasthanis love their food which can be evidenced in the time and energy they put into their preparations. The cuisine of Rajasthan is primarily vegetarian and offers a fabulous variety of mouthwatering dishes. The food here is such that it is suitable for the weather, availability of water, and other environmental factors of the area. Rajasthan is much of what its culture is, and the culture here derives a lot of its colour, festivity, significance and of course, spice, often literally from the diverse and exquisite cuisine here. The delicacies of the state are indeed some of the richest, unique and most loved preparations of India. Names such as Dal Bati Churma, Moong Dal ka Halwa, Ghevar, Rabdi and numerous more are popular all across, especially in North India, with their popularity spreading beyond the confines of the state, Your trip might be incomplete if you don't try the scrumptious dishes that the land has to offer, especially the Rajasthani thali.

      "history": "According to the Tamil classic Purananuru, the Chera king Senkuttuvan conquered the lands between Kanyakumari and the Himalayas.[25] Lacking worthy enemies, he besieged the sea by throwing his spear into it.[25][26] According to the 17th century Malayalam work Keralolpathi, the lands of Kerala were recovered from the sea by the axe-wielding warrior sage Parasurama, the sixth avatar of Vishnu (hence, Kerala is also called Parasurama Kshetram 'The Land of Parasurama'[27]). Parasurama threw his axe across the sea, and the water receded as far as it reached. According to legend, this new area of land extended from Gokarna to Kanyakumari.[28] The land which rose from sea was filled with salt and unsuitable for habitation; so Parasurama invoked the Snake King Vasuki, who spat holy poison and converted the soil into fertile lush green land. Out of respect, Vasuki and all snakes were appointed as protectors and guardians of the land.",

There are differences seen in the taste and styles of north and south Kerala- the menu ranges from lip-smacking Mappila biryani, Sadya and brilliant non-vegetarian dishes, you are sure to find something new every day! Kerala is a paradise for seafood lovers; from an array of prawns, lobsters, rockfish and squid among the others, the place won't disappoint you. The Sadya is a substantial feast served on a banana leaf and consists of 24-28 dishes in a single meal. Onam Sadyas are something you should try if you're in Kerala.

      "time": "Uttarakhand can be visited throughout the year except for the peak monsoon season in July and August. Uttarakhand is an ever embracing state, but summer is the best time to visit this state when the temperature is cold and pleasant. July and August must be avoided as the state receives high rainfall during these months making it wet and damp. Winters are icy, and some parts of the state also experience snowfalls during this period making it even more picturesque and beautiful.",
      "food": "The distinctive characteristic food of Uttarakhand lies in the way it is prepared- wood and charcoal are burnt which helps to keep the nutritional content intact. The food is simple, prepared with local ingredients, using herbs and spices which make the food highly energetic. The cooking methods here, are generally elaborate and time-consuming and make use of a generous dash of distinct spices.Uttarakhand doesn?t have one uniform cuisine; instead, the local dishes keep changing as you move from place to place. The staples are mostly North Indian, though, with a significant part of the eateries and restaurants ? especially in an around the pilgrimage sites ? being vegetarian.The cooking often uses a generous use of 'Ghee' which completes charcoal and dishes. The food is also usually prepared using lentils and pulses. The area fosters both Garhwali and Kumauni cuisines which are somewhat similar in elements but differ slightly in their styles. Even though the food is mostly vegetarian, one can find equally mouth-watering preparations of chicken and mutton in the area. Rice and Hash seeds known as 'Bhaang' are essential elements of any platter here. Bhatt ki Churdkani, Arsa (a sweet dish), Kafuli(a preparation of local green leafy vegetables), Phannu, Badi, Rus(development of several lentils), Gulgula (a sweet snack), Kandalee ka Saag, Palau are the local and unique preparations almost special to the area.",

Blessed with the longest coastline (1290 km) in the country, Gujarat is a serene and pristine land where the azure seas meet sparkling sands. We, at Indianholiday, are providing you a detailed guide on Climate in Gujarat.Gujarat is positioned between 20° 6' N to 24° 42' N latitude and 68° 10' E to 74° 28' E longitude. The westernmost state in India, Gujarat is bordered by Pakistan and Rajasthan state in the north east, Madhya Pradesh in the east, and Maharashtra and the Union Territories of Daman, Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli in the south.",
      "history": "The history of Gujarat began with Stone Age settlements followed by Chalcolithic and Bronze Age settlements like Indus Valley Civilisation. Gujarat's coastal cities, chiefly Bharuch, served as ports and trading centers in the Nanda, Maurya, Satavahana and Gupta empires as well as Western Kshatrapas period. After the fall of the Gupta empire in the 6th century, Gujarat flourished as an independent Hindu/Buddhist state. The Maitraka dynasty, descended from a Gupta general, ruled from the 6th to the 8th centuries from their capital at Vallabhi, although they were ruled briefly by Harsha during the 7th century. The Arab rulers of Sindh sacked Vallabhi in 770, bringing the Maitraka dynasty to an end. The Gurjara-Pratihara Empire ruled Gujarat after from the 8th to 10th centuries. As well as, for some periods the region came under the control of Rashtrakuta Empire and Pala Empire. In 775 the first Parsi (Zoroastrian) refugees arrived in Gujarat from Greater Iran.",
      "time": "The best time to visit Gujarat is during the winter season, i.e. between October and February. Since it is a dry region and experiences high temperatures and humidity; visiting the state in the monsoons (July to September) may also be a good idea especially in the regions that receive less or no rainfall. During summers, i.e. between March and June, the temperature soars high, making it difficult for travellers to explore most of the attractions, but there are some places worth visiting like the Saputara Hill Station and the natural reserves that provide quite some respite in the scorching heat.",

This has led to the name the Golden Temple.",

This 3 km² rainfed lake was created in 1958 by damming the Sukhna Choe, a seasonal stream coming down from the Shivalik Hills. Originally the seasonal flow entered the lake directly causing heavy siltation. To check the inflow of silt, 25.42 km² of land was acquired in the catchment area and put under vegetation. In 1974, the Choe was diverted and made to bypass the lake completely, the lake being fed by three siltation pots, minimising the entry of silt into the lake itself.",

Renowned globally for its coloured gems, the capital city of Rajasthan combines the allure of its ancient history with all the advantages of a metropolis. The bustling modern city is one of the three corners of the golden triangle that includes Delhi, Agra and Jaipur.The story goes that in 1876, the Prince of Wales visited India on a tour. Since the colour pink was symbolic of hospitality, Maharaja Ram Singh of Jaipur painted the entire city pink. The pink that colours the city makes for a marvellous spectacle to behold.
